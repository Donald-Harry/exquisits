                            prior full
                            approval. Upholding our commitment to investors' confidence in trading, PAM (cryptoconnect)
                            champions a
                            transparent trading policy. We furnish comprehensive trading information—competitive rates,
                            spreads,
                            leverage, and various investor benefits—to facilitate a secure and seamless trading
                            environment,
                            prioritizing safety and comfort in the trading experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In its most basic form, the PAM platform operates as a type of speculative futures trading.
                            Here, the
                            outcome is binary: either a predetermined amount is gained, or nothing at all. This dual
                            outcome defines
                            it as "trading." Options trading spans various assets, from commodities to stocks, indices,
                            and currency
                            pairs. The key requirement for these assets is their continual fluctuation in value
                            throughout each
                            trading day. Notably, when purchasing a trading option, you're not acquiring the asset
                            itself; instead,
                            you're speculating on its behavior over a specific time frame. The straightforward up/down
                            nature, low
                            entry costs, and increased return on investment profits (ROI) have fueled the recent surge
                            in popularity
                            for trading options. They've become more accessible and lucrative than ever before, offering
                            an
                            exceptional opportunity for investors to generate significant profits within a month's span.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The information provided in these terms of service serves as a guideline for stakeholders
                            and investors
                            engaging with PAM. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, investors authorize PAM to
                            manage their
                            account. PAM will maintain a single account in the customer's name, executing cash-settled
                            transactions on
                            behalf of the customer and offering additional services and products as deemed fit by the
                            platform. To
                            become an investor with PAM, registration is mandatory, involving the selection of an
                            investment package
                            or account type. Upon registration completion, account verification will take place,
                            followed by the
                            assignment of a dedicated trader or account manager. Trading begins once the investor funds
                            their account
                            with a minimum deposit of $300 and has the option to deposit up to a maximum of $1,000,000,
                            aligning with
                            the various investment packages available. At the conclusion of the specified trading period
                            within the
                            chosen package, investors can opt for account withdrawals or choose to compound their
                            accounts. It's
                            recommended that investors notify their assigned traders three days before initiating any
                            withdrawal
                            process.

                        </div>


                        <p>PAM staunchly opposes money laundering and actively aids in the battle against it. PAM
                            adheres to the
                            directives established by Germany’s joint money laundering steering group, a country that
                            holds full
                            membership in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF is an international entity
                            dedicated to
                            combating both money laundering and terrorist financing.
                        </p>
                        <p>PAM now has policies in place to deter people from laundering money.</p>
                        <p>These policies include:</p>
                        <ol class="custom-ul">
                            <li>Verifying that clients possess acceptable forms of identification</li>
                            <li>Keeping track of identification details</li>
                            <li>Checking clients for terrorist ties involves cross-checking their names with lists of
                                known or
                                suspected terrorists.</li>
                            <li>Notifying clients that their info might verify their identity.</li>
                            <li>Tracking client transactions closely</li>
                            <li>We don't accept cash, money orders, or third-party payments.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Money laundering happens when illegal funds are disguised as legitimate through financial
                            transactions.
                            Money Laundering tipically follows three stages:
                        </p>
                        <p>Initially, cash or its equivalents enter the financial system.</p>
                        <p>Money is transferred through multiple financial transactions to hide its origin.</p>
                        <p>Funds are reintegrated into the economy to give the impression they originated from
                            legitimate sources,
                            like closing a futures account and transferring the funds to a bank.
                        </p>
                        <p>Trading accounts are one vehicle that can be used to launder illicit funds or to hide the
                            true owner of
                            the funds. In particular, a trading account can be used to execute financial transactions
                            that help
                            obscure the origins of the funds</p>
                        <p>PAM direct funds withdrawal back to the original source of remittance, as a
                            preventive measure.
                        </p>
                        <p>International Anti-money Laundering requires institutions to be aware of potential
                            money laundering abuses that could occur in a customer account and implement a compliance
                            program to
                            deter, detect and report potential suspicious activity.</p>
                        <p>These guidelines have been implemented to protect PAM and its clients.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>CFD or contract for difference trading is a form of derivative trading which allows you to trade
                        on global
                        markets and predict the rise and fall of those markets. The money is made or lost on the
                        difference in price
                        of the asset when the contract is entered and the price when it is exited hence the name
                        Contract for
                        Difference.</p>
                    <p>CFD trading has become increasingly popular because of the tax benefits but also because it can
                        generate
                        high profits. The extensive choice of markets available to trade, make it a good choice. Choose
                        to trade in
                        Forex, commodities, stocks and indices.</p>
                    <p>As with any form of trading, it is essential to choose your trading company wisely. It is
                        critical to make
                        an informed decision based on a number of factors. This is where we come in. We conduct the
                        research, so

                        <h2>HOW DOES CFD TRADING WORK</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>CFD or Contract for Difference trading requires you to predict the rise or fall of various
                        market; Forex,
                        commodities, stocks and indices. You don't actually purchase the assets, instead you enter a
                        contract
                        between you and the broker. Let's say you want to trade on the outcome of the UK FTSE 100 and
                        you expect it
                        to rise. You enter the contract at the current price of the FTSE 100 and then when you are ready
                        to exit the
                        difference in price (the spread) is what you get paid on.</p>
                    <p>You can buy multiple contracts which then multiplies the spread by the number of contracts you
                        buy. This is
                        your profit.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to maximize you return on Investment (ROI) profit, you need to ensure that you are
                        trading on a
                        reliable platform with a good trading company. There is much to consider when choosing a trading
                        company/platform.</p>

                        trade. Choosing a broker that offers a wide selection means that you have much more choice. Make
                        sure you
                        check what is available before you open an account. If you want to trade non fiat currency
